# [DBFZ BBS Lookup](https://dobosken.github.io/dbfz_bbs_lookup/)

A website to quickly browse DBFZ BBS and it's documentation.

Uses [Broscar's custom DBFZ BBS](https://github.com/dobosken/bbscript) for the `name_given` field, but the ID numbers will always match up, so you can use this tool regardless of which exact variant of BBS you use.

A lot of the documentation was taken from [the old BBS doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r8Uv-jz6R8VQuGp42_XV42vl4a1ZdWyxUEDlduMI3vM), which was put together by me, Burrito, Flamescorpi0 and Abayomi.
