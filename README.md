# [DBFZ BBS Lookup](https://dobosken.github.io/dbfz_bbs_lookup/)

A website to quickly search for and reference DBFZ bbs documentation.

Uses [Broscar's mixed dbfz.ron](https://github.com/dobosken/dbfz_ron) as a base, but the IDs will always match up, so you can use this tool regardless of which exact dbfz.ron you use.
